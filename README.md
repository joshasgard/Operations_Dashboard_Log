# Operations_Dashboard_Log

## Introduction
The repo contains a thermal generator unit performance dashboard made with MS Excel with daily log sheets incorporated. This was made by me with hopes of resolving and improving upon the deficiencies
observed with traditional MSWord logging in Egbin Thermal Power Station. 

## Motivation
``The following problems and improvement areas were identified:``
- Difficulty finding and referencing log sheets.
- time taken to fill logs and punch calculators
- no operator defined method of keeping track of the unit condition and performance over time [Megawatts, water consumption, and gas]
- an accessible and quick snapshot of the latest activities on each unit for all operations staff.``

``Objectives``
 - immediately standardizing unit daily logging,
- familiarise operators with unit status & performance with live graphical representations and more importantly,
- immediately align operations as a department with key company culture elements like data driven decision-making at all levels

## File Description
``.xlsx`` file contains the dashboard and log sheets. The ``.pdf`` provides detailed description of the features and worksheets.
